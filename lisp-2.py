RIP should have used version control


This was an implementation mush like lisp-1, but using iterators and termios
to have a nicer cli experience.

I carried some of this decisions and solutions forward into lisp-3
but decided to use pythons readline library for the basic cli stuff, 
and focus more on the lisp itself
